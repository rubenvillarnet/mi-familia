This is a simple game to help my kid recognize and learn his closest relatives names.

It displays a list of images and plays the person's name when clicked.

I've added a few perks, as:
- It's installable as a PWA.
- If it is installed it detects touch events, in addition to click.
- It adjusts its height in mobile browsers in order to be full height but without scroll bars.

I don't know if I'll add more features (excluding changing the images or the audios) as in it's current state it serves its purpouse.
